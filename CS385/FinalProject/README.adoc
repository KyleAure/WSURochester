.Project Description
****
Create a database for Quarry Hill Nature Center's summer camp registration.
Include design decisions, normalizations,
****

== Course Details
* **Course** - CS385: Applied Database Management
* **Instructor** - Dr. Nicole Anderson

== Running project
Database file is provided but there are no special commands to run this project.
Just use a GUI database management system such as SQLite to view tables and queries.

== Designing Database

=== Design Decisions
We started by creating tables as we saw relationships in data in the brochure.
To begin with we knew we would need data on a camper, the camp, emergency contact, and fees.
As we went we made relationships for all of the attributes that we knew we wanted to track.

.General Relationships
* Camper:camperID -> fName, lName, age, email, memberStatus, emergencyContact
* Camp:campAbr -> campName, description, feeRate, ageRange, sessionNo, startDate, endDate, am_pm
* EmergencyContact:contactNo -> fName, lName, phoneNum
* Fee:feeRate -> nonMember, member, payStatus

=== Normalization
Based on the generic relationships above we then looked at creating functional relationships.
During this process we also made sure to normalize data to get rid of all partial and transitive dependencies.

.Independent Functional Relationships (No foreign keys)
* EmergencyContact:eContactID -> fName, lName, phoneNum
* AgeRange:rangeNo -> youngest, oldest
* Fee:feeRate -> nonMember, member
* DateRange:dateNo -> startDate, endDate

.Dependent Functional Relationships (With foreign keys)
* Camper:camperID -> fName, lName, age, email, memberStatus, _eContactID_
* CampInfo:campAbr -> campName, description, feeRate, _rangeNo_
* Camp:campAbr + sessionNo -> _dateNo_, am_pm
* Registration:camperID + campAbr + sessionNo -> payStatus

After reviewing every relationship no transitive dependencies exist that we could determine.

== Entity Relationship Diagram
After we made all the design decisions and normalized the database we created the following Entity Relationship (ER) diagram.
After adding the entities and attributes we created relationships between them as follows.

.Relationships with Multiplicity
* EmergencyContact(0..1) - needs - (1..\*)Camper
* Campers(1..\*) - requires - (0..\*)Registration
* Registration(0..\*) - contains - (1)Camp
* Camp(0..\*) - held during - (1)DateRange
* Camp(1..\*) - describes - (0..1)CampInfo
* CampInfo(0..\*) - has - (1)Fee
* CampInfo(0..\*) - grouped in - (1)AgeRange

== Database Model
We decided to use a Relational model for this Database.
We choose to use a Relational model since after creating our relationships and normalization.
The resulting relationships can directly be correlated to tables of a relational database.
Additionally, the ability to use primary and foreign keys to link tables together would make for easy query writing.
