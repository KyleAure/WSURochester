** So that there is a percieved risk to attacking the system.
8. According to the author, what is needed for random detection to work? Do you agree?
** Punishment must exceed the crime or be percieved this way.
9. Failures are a critical problem for which system?
** Detection -> if they get past 
10. Is it true that all detection systems have weaknesses? How could an attacker discover them?

11. What are audits (and not just an evil IRS technique!) ?
** Records
12. Double-entry bookkeeping systems have two main purposes, what are they?
** Reduce the posibility of fruad and detect errors
13. Are audits prospective or retrospective? Why?

** Taking precausions over attacks that you predict.
