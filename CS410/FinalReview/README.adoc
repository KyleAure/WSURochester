== Chapter 9

1. List on the board the three types of software maintenance. Verbally describe them.
** *Fault Repair:* to fix bugs and vulnerabilities.
** *Environmental Adaptation:* to adapt software to new platforms and environments. Required when hardware, the platform operating system, or other support software changes.

2. List on the board the 5 “Bad smells” improvable by software refactoring. Verbally describe them.
** *Duplicate Code:* the same or very similar code can be removed and implemented as a single method that is called when required.
** *Long Methods:* Redesign long methods into a number of shorter methods. Should only do one thing.
** *Switch-Case Statements:* These often involve duplication, where the switch depends on the type of a value. In object-oriented language, you can use polymorphism to achieve the same thing.
** *Data Clumping:* Data clumps occur when the same group of data items (fields in classes, parameters in methods) reoccurs in several places in a program. Replace with an object that encapsulates all of the data.
** *Speculative Generality:* This occurs when developers include generality in a program in case it is required in the future. This can often simply be removed.
3. List on the board the four strategic options for dealing legacy systems. Verbally describe them.

+
** Typically related to hardware failures.  Inputs are passed to identical systems.  The outputs are examined to determine if there was a hardware fault in either of the systems. If a fault is detected and status code is returned.  That output value is ignored and the redundant system is used.
4. Draw a diagram representing N-version programming.  Verbally discuss the diagram.

5.	List on the board the eight dependable programming guidelines. Verbally describe them.
** Limit the *visibility* of information. Do not crowd the name-space and ensure that data is only accessible to components that need them.
** Check all inputs for *validity*. Type checking, range checking, regular expressions, etc.
** Provide a *handler for all exceptions*. If an exception occurs it should be handled without system failure.
** Minimize the use of *Error-Prone constructs*. Language or system specific constructs that tend to fail such as the accuracy of floating point numbers.
** Provide *restart* capabilities. If system fails, provide a means to restart while loosing a minimum amount of data.
** Check *array bounds*. Ensure that when accessing an array that the index is within the bounds of the array.
** *Timeout* when calling external components.  If an external system call is made, provide a timeout period so that system function does not cease due to a faulty external system.
** Name *constants*. Meaningfully especially when they represent real-world values.
