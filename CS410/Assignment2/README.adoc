== Questions
1. List and describe the five essential attributes of good software. (2 points)
+
.Essential attributes of good software
|===
|Attribute |Description

|Acceptability
|Software being produced must meet the needs of the intended users.

|Dependability
|In the event of a system failure, dependable software should not cause harm.

|Security
|Only non-malicious users should be able to access or change the system.


|Efficiency
|A piece of software should not use an excess of system resources.

|Maintainability
|Software should be written in a way, such that, it can evolve to meet future customers needs.
|===
+
2. What is a software process?
List and describe the four fundamental activities that are common to all software processes. (2 points)
** Software Process: The sequence of activities that leads to the development of a software product.
+
.Fundamental activities to the Software Process
|===
|Activity |Description

|Software specification
|Where consumers and developers define how the software is going to be produced, and define any constraints.

|Software development
|Where the software is designed and programmed.

|Software validation
|Where the software is tested to ensure it meets the specification.

|Software evolution
|Where the software is modified to meet changing customer requirements.
|===
3. Consider the four case studies presented in the book.
Which do you think would be most expensive to develop?
Discuss at least 4 reasons why it would be more expensive than the other case studies. (3 points)
** I think the most expensive to develop would be the Wilderness Weather Station.
*** Similar to the Insulin Pump this is an embedded system.
But it needs to be able to operate with and without network connection, requiring the ability to cache data and transmit later.
*** Not only does the system need to monitor the weather it also needs to monitor it's internal systems to ensure batteries and generator are operational.
*** Unlike the other systems, communication with this system is done via satellite so extra optimization would need to be done to ensure communication can be done on minimum bandwidth.
*** Lastly, this system would be difficult to update due to the location of the weather stations and the limited bandwidth.
Therefore, more cost would need to be put into initial development, testing, etc. to ensure everything works prior to deployment.
4. List and describe the five stages of the waterfall model.
For each stage, name the corresponding fundamental activity from question 2. (3 points)
+
.Stages of Waterfall Model
|===
|Stage |Activity

|Requirement's Definition
|Define system services, constraints, and goals from users.

|System and Software Design
|Define system architecture, allocate hardware/software systems, and complete software design.

|Implementation and Unit Testing
|Programs or units are created.  Tests for each program or unit are created to ensure requirements are meet.

|Integration and System Testing
|Programs or units are integrated as a system and tested to customer requirements. Then system is delivered to customer.

|Operation and Maintenance
|Error correction, improvements, and other change requests are integrated into the system.
|===
5. Describe the main activities in the software design process and the outputs of these activities.
Using a diagram, show possible relationships between the outputs of these activities. (3 points)
+
.Software Design Process
|===
|Activity |Outputs |Relationship

|Architectural Design
|Overall structure of system including; relationships, main components, and distribution.
|Architecture may be influence by existing Database Systems or Components that are flagged for reuse.

|Database Design
|Creation of a new database or use of existing database. Design of data structures and database representation.
|Architecture may limit database option and possible compatibility issues with other component systems.

|Interface Design
|Interface between system components and how communication between components will be handled.
|Coupling of system components and interfaces may depend the main components defined in the architecture.

|Component Selection and Design
|Search for reusable components, design new components, and design modeling (UML).
|Component compatibility will depend heavily on all the other design decisions.
|===
6. Explain why systems developed as prototypes should not normally be used as production systems. (2 points)

Prototype systems typically provide limited service and are used for customers to try and redefine requirements.
Typically, prototype systems do not provide the level of security and dependability required to be safely used as a production system.
Additionally, this could lead to premature commitment to requirements, when customer requirements might change after prototype is produced.
