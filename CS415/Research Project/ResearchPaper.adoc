= Outline
== Development
* How do you get the programming language?
* What IDEs can you use?
* What platforms does it run on?
* Examples of use.
* Samples of code.
* Is there community support?
* Is there corporate support?
* How easy was it for you to learn?

== Ease of Using Lanaguage
* SYNTAX: What forms does the language allow?
** How does the programmer know how to construct statements that will be accepted by the complier?
** Standard notation system?

* SEMANTICS: What does this form mean?
** Is there any ambiguity? (for example dangling else)

* EXPRESSIVENESS: Is there consistancy with commonly used notation?
** Is arithetic infix, postfix, or prefix?
** How are assignments (=) and assertions (==) differentiated?
** How is input-output handled?

* UNIFORM: Do similar constructs have similar meanings?
** If I pass a parameter to a function will it be taken by value or reference?

* ORTHOGONAL: Are all concepts independent from one another?

* GENERAL: Can this language handle any type of problem?
** What cannot be done?

*PEDAGOGY: Is it easy to learn?
** In general how easy is the language to pickup?

== Software Engineering
* RELIABILITY: Is it difficult for errors to go unnoticed by the compiler/programmer?
** What sort of type checking is done?
** How readable is the program?

* MODULARITY: Can a large program be broken up into moduals?
** Are functions, subroutines, libraries, etc supported?

* EXTENSIBLE: Can a programmer easily create and use new data types to fit the problem at hand?
** What data types are supported?
** What data structures are included in the Lanaguage?

* PROVEABILITY: Can formal methods be used to prove the correctness of a program?

== Performance
* FAST COMPILATION: How long does compilation take?
** How is the program compiled?

* EFFICIENT OBJECT CODE: How much object code is producted after compilation?
** Does the language make neccessary verbose object code?

* PORTABILITY: Can a program be run on different opperating systems?
** Does it need to be recompiled?
