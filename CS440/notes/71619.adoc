== Course Details
* **Course** - CS440
* **Instructor** - Dr. Shimin Li

== Graph Alogrithms

=== General
* asciimath:[G=(V,E)]
* *V*: is the set of nodes
* *E*: is the set of edges _e_
* asciimath:[e = {u,v}]

== Direction
* A Graph can be either *undirected* or *directed*
* *Directed*: asciimath:[e={u,v}={v,u}]
* *Undirected* asciimath:[e={u,v}!={v,u}=e']

=== Examples
Examples of graph useages:
* Networks
* Flight Info
* Chess Game

=== Veticies Edges and Degree
* asciimath:[n = abs(V)]: n is the number of verticies
* asciimath:[m = abs(E)]: m is the number of edges such that asciimath:[0<=m<=(n*(n-1))/2]
* A graph always has asciimath:[m = sum_(i=1)^n d_i = 2*m] edges. Where asciimath:[d_i] is the degree at node _i_.
* Degree of a node is the number of edges connecting to that node.
* A graph is a *sparce graph* if asciimath:[m=O(n) or m=c*n]
* A graph is a *complete graph* if asciimath:[m=n(n-1)/2]

=== Paths
* A *path* is a sequence of nodes, such that, each consecutive pair is connected by an edge.
* The *length* of a path is equal to the number of edges connecting two nodes
* The *shortest path* between _s_ and _t_ is the path with the least length
* The *distance* between _s_ and _t_ is the length of the shortest path

=== Connectivity
* A graph is a *connected graph* if for any pair of nodes {_v_,_u_} there exists a path _p_ that connects _v_ and _u_

=== Trees
* A *tree* is a subset of a graph

Properties::
. Has no cycles
. is connected
. has n-1 edges
