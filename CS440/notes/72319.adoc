== Dijkstra's Algorithm
Input::
* A directed graph G
* A start node _s_
* Each edge has a length > 0
Output::
* The shortest paths from _s_ to all the other nodes in G

----
Dijkstra(G,s):							#TOTAL: O((n+m)logn)
	for each node v:    				#O(n)
		v.d = INFINITY
		v.pre = NULL
	s.d=0
	Q <- all nodes in G  				#O(n)
	while Q NOT Empty:
		u <- Extract-Min(Q)  			#O(nlogn) #Min-heap key distance from s
		for each v in adj(u):			#O(mlogn)
			if u.d + len(u,v) < v.d
				v.d = u.d + len(u,v)
				DecreaseKey(Q.v, u.d)	#O(logn)
				v.pre = u

== Minimum Spanning Tree
Definition::
* Given a graph G=(V,E), G is connected
* Each edge has a positive cost/length
* i.e. (e(u,v))>0
Goal::
* to find a subset of edges T SUB E
* So that G'=(V,T) is connected
* The total cost/length is as small as possible
