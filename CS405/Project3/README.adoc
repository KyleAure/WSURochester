.Project Description
****
Create a project that simulates the inner workings of a page replacement.
****

== Course Details
* **Course** - CS405: Operating Systems
* **Instructor** -  Dr. Dennis Martin

== Project Goals
* Implement both Least Recently Used (LRU) and First In First Out (FIFO) replacement alogrithms.
* Keep track of all page faults.
* Print the state of mainstore after a page fault.

== Getting Started
=== Prerequisites
This is a Java project that uses a Maven build architecure.
Prior to running this project you will need to download and install maven on your local system.
Instructions on how to install maven can be found here:
link:https://maven.apache.org/install.html[]

To check to see if you have Maven installed correctly run the `mvn --version` command.
You should see output similar to:

```bash
Apache Maven 3.5.4 (1edded0938998edf8bf061f1ceb3cfdeccf443fe; 2018-06-17T13:33:14-05:00)
Maven home: /Applications/maven
Java version: 1.8.0_161, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_161.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.14.3", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
```

=== Installing
Since we are using Maven, all you need to do to install this program is to run the `mvn install` command.
Running this command will do the following:

1. Download all dependencies.
2. Put dependencies on the project's build path.
3. Runs automated tests.
4. Build the project.
5. Package the project as a -jar.

=== Running the Project
Once you have installed the project you can run it by using the following command, or by opening the .jar file located in the `/target/` folder that was generated int he last step.

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="edu.winona.cs.paging.App"
```
== User Interface
When running this project the user is prompted via a User-Interface (GUI) to choose the settings prior to running.

First the user chooses the Replacement Algorithm they want to use.  LRU or FIFO:

image::assets/chooseAlgo.png[]

The user will then need to choose the number of frames in the main store:

image::assets/frames.png[]

Finally, the user is asked to choose a .json file that has the page information.

image::assets/chooseFile.png[]

== Output
Once the settings and file have been selected, the program creates a output.log file.
This file holds the output for the program; which includes, algorithm, number of frames, and the main store after faults.

== Results
For this project I used the sample data provided here:

```json
include::data.json[]
```

I have stored the resulting logs in the `/logs/` directory within this projects.
Results and links to the resulting logs file here:
